Born on May 29, 2002, in Fullerton, California, he played college baseball at the Air Force Academy before transferring to LSU, where he led the Tigers to the 2023 College World Series title. Skenes was selected first overall by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 2023 MLB Draft and made his major league debut in 2024. He quickly established himself as one of baseball’s premier young aces, combining elite velocity with a devastating mix of secondary pitches, and continues to anchor the Pirates’ rotation as a frontline starter.\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Skenes - Career Statistics\n\n\nSeason\nTeam\nAge\nW\nL\nSV\nG\nGS\nIP\nK/9\nBB/9\nHR/9\nBABIP\nGB%\nvFA\nERA\nxERA\nFIP\nxFIP\nWAR\n\n\n\n\n2024\nPIT\n22\n11\n3\n0\n23\n23\n133.0\n11.50\n2.17\n0.68\n0.284\n51.30%\n98.9\n1.96\n2.52\n2.44\n2.54\n4.3\n\n\n2025\nPIT\n23\n10\n10\n0\n32\n32\n187.2\n10.36\n2.01\n0.53\n0.273\n44.30%\n98.2\n1.97\n2.63\n2.36\n3.03\n6.5\n\n\nTotal\nNA\nNA\n21\n13\n0\n55\n55\n320.2\n10.83\n2.08\n0.59\n0.277\n47.10%\n98.5\n1.96\n2.58\n2.40\n2.83\n10.8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Sample of Paul Skenes’s Arsenal (100 Pitches) - Catcher’s Perspective\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Skenes - 2025 Pitch Mix\n\n\npitch_name\nn\npercent\n\n\n\n\n4-Seam Fastball\n1196\n39.9%\n\n\nSweeper\n476\n15.9%\n\n\nSplit-Finger\n409\n13.6%\n\n\nChangeup\n326\n10.9%\n\n\nSinker\n279\n9.3%\n\n\nSlider\n171\n5.7%\n\n\nCurveball\n140\n4.7%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaul Skenes - 2025 Pitch Attributes (Median)\n\n\npitch_name\nrelease_speed\nax\naz\nrelease_spin_rate\nspin_axis_x\nspin_axis_z\n\n\n\n\n4-Seam Fastball\n98.2\n-18.134856\n-18.10343\n2266\n-0.8480481\n-0.5299193\n\n\nSinker\n97.6\n-21.900695\n-24.19573\n2272\n-0.8660254\n-0.5000000\n\n\nSplit-Finger\n93.6\n-15.457214\n-32.08898\n1683\n-0.9396926\n-0.3420201\n\n\nChangeup\n88.8\n-16.953735\n-26.28521\n1801\n-0.9902681\n-0.1391731\n\n\nSlider\n85.2\n2.216290\n-25.30748\n2326\n0.9816272\n-0.1564345\n\n\nSweeper\n84.5\n8.549715\n-26.92541\n2337\n0.9902681\n0.0174524\n\n\nCurveball\n83.9\n3.959596\n-34.13282\n2446\n0.9876883\n0.1391731"
