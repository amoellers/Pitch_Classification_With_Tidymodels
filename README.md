# Pitch Classification With Tidymodels

This repository explores the use of machine learning algorithms to classify Major League Baseball (MLB) pitches based on Statcast's pitch tracking data. By leveraging pitch characteristics such as velocity and spin rate, the project aims to automatically identify pitch types (e.g., fastball, slider, curveball, changeup).
